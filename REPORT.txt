- How did you design your benchmarks?

Our benchmarks wrote to every address in the MMAPed range. We also tried other versions that only wrote to one address per page. This triggers the page fault handler as frequently as possible, which disadvantages small pages and demand paging.

- What performance differences did you see?

Huge versus base: 0.0056s vs 0.0058s on average over 10 runs for "file" size 1048576 [1.05 MB]
Populate versus base: 0.1664s vs 0.1769s on average over 10 runs for file size 68461064 [68.5 MB]

- If you have time / interest, lets try to look at what exactly caused these
performance differences above. Our hardware has special performance counters
for measuring certain events such as number of cache misses, cycles per
instruction, etc. We can use these counters ourselves using the perf
commandline tool. `perf list` will print a list of all the counters your
hardware + OS support. Which counters did you find most interesting? What
results did you observe?

This seems cool.
