- How did you design your benchmarks?
Our benchmarks just wrote to every address in the MMAPed range.

- What performance differences did you see?
Huge versus base: 0.00563785s vs 0.00585105s
Populate versus base: 0.166414s vs 0.175814s

- If you have time / interest, lets try to look at what exactly caused these
performance differences above. Our hardware has special performance counters
for measuring certain events such as number of cache misses, cycles per
instruction, etc. We can use these counters ourselves using the perf
commandline tool. `perf list` will print a list of all the counters your
hardware + OS support. Which counters did you find most interesting? What
results did you observe?
